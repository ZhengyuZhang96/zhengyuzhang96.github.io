I'm currently an Assistant Professor with the School of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China. I received the B.E. degree from Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China, the M.E. degree from Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the National Institute of Applied Sciences, Rennes, France, in 2018, 2021, and 2024, respectively. My research interests include image/video quality assessment, 3D reconstruction, light field imaging, visual perception, and deep learning. I has published 20+ papers in top journals and conferences, including IEEE TIP, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT and IEEE JSTSP. I am currently leading the research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province.
